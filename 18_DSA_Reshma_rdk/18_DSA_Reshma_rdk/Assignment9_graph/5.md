# Assignment 5 — Graph Traversals Using Adjacency List 

## Title  
Graph Representation Using Adjacency List and Performing BFS & DFS Traversals

## Objective  
To write a program that accepts a graph from the user, represents it using an **adjacency list**, and performs **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** traversals.

## Theory  
A graph is a collection of vertices connected by edges.  
It can be represented in multiple ways; the **adjacency list** is memory-efficient for sparse graphs.  

### BFS (Breadth-First Search)  
- Traverses neighbors level-by-level using a queue.  
- Useful for shortest path in unweighted graphs.

### DFS (Depth-First Search)  
- Traverses as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.  
- Typically implemented using recursion or a stack.

### Adjacency List Representation  
- Each vertex stores a list of connected vertices.  
- Efficient in space compared to adjacency matrix for sparse graphs.

## Algorithm  

### 1. Build Adjacency List  
1. Input number of vertices  
2. Input number of edges  
3. For each edge (u, v):  
   - Add `v` to adjacency list of `u`  
   - Add `u` to adjacency list of `v` (for undirected graph)

### 2. DFS Traversal  
1. Mark all vertices as unvisited  
2. Call DFS recursively from starting vertex  
3. Visit vertex, mark it visited  
4. Recur for all unvisited neighbors

### 3. BFS Traversal  
1. Mark all vertices as unvisited  
2. Start from a vertex, push it to queue  
3. While queue not empty:  
   - Pop vertex, mark as visited  
   - Push all unvisited neighbors to queue

## Code (C++)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

void DFS(int v, vector<bool>& visited, vector<int> adj[]) {
    visited[v] = true;
    cout << v << " ";
    for (int u : adj[v]) {
        if (!visited[u])
            DFS(u, visited, adj);
    }
}

void BFS(int start, vector<int> adj[], int n) {
    vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(start);
    visited[start] = true;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int v = q.front(); q.pop();
        cout << v << " ";
        for (int u : adj[v]) {
            if (!visited[u]) {
                visited[u] = true;
                q.push(u);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, e;
    cout << "Enter number of vertices: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Enter number of edges: ";
    cin >> e;

    vector<int> adj[20];

    cout << "Enter edges (u v):\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < e; i++) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u); // undirected graph
    }

    vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    cout << "\nDFS Traversal starting from vertex 0: ";
    DFS(0, visited, adj);

    cout << "\nBFS Traversal starting from vertex 0: ";
    BFS(0, adj, n);

    return 0;
}


Sample Ouput:
Enter number of vertices: 5
Enter number of edges: 6
Enter edges (u v):
0 1
0 2
1 3
1 4
2 4
3 4

DFS Traversal starting from vertex 0: 0 1 3 4 2
BFS Traversal starting from vertex 0: 0 1 2 3 4
